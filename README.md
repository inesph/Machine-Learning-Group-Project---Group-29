# Machine-Learning-Group-Project---Group-29
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the "Claim Injury Type" for workers based on various injury-related features. 

This project aimed to develop an efficient and user-friendly platform for the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) staff to predict the Claim Injury Type for workers. The main goal was to facilitate decision-making by automating the classification of injury types based on historical claims data. To achieve this, we implemented a machine learning solution using a variety of preprocessing techniques, including handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistent values, followed by feature selection to reduce the number of variables without compromising the model’s quality. We explored multiple machine learning algorithms, from traditional models like DecisionTreeClassifier to more complex ones such as neural networks and ensemble methods. After testing these models, the StackingClassifier proved to be the most effective model, and it was then improved, achieving a 0.7255 F1 Weighted score.

To make the model accessible to non-technical users, we developed a platform using Streamlit. This interface allows WCB staff to input features related to a worker’s injury and receive immediate predictions along with a confidence score, as well as feature importance information, all derived from the trained model. Despite the promising performance of the final model, some challenges were faced, including the imbalanced target variable and the large dataset size. Future work may, therefore, be done with advanced techniques for balancing the target variable and further refining the model to improve its performance in minority classed. Overall, this project successfully meets its objective of providing WCB staff with an effective, easy-to-use tool to assist in the claims process, and demonstrates the potential of machine learning in improving operational efficiency.
